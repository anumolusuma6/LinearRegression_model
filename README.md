# LinearRegression_Simple Model
### Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model using Python/R to predict a target variable based on a single predictor variable.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains:

- X: Predictor variable (independent variable)
- Y: Target variable (dependent variable)
### Steps Involved
- Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Load the dataset and explore its structure.
Check for missing values and outliers.
Visualize the relationship between X and Y using scatter plots.
- Model Development

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Fit a simple linear regression model to the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc.
- Model Interpretation

Interpret the coefficients of the regression model.
- Discuss the significance of the predictor variable (X) in predicting the target variable (Y).
- Prediction and Visualization

Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
Visualize the regression line along with the scatter plot of the data points.
### Technologies Used
Python/R (with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook (optional)
Git (version control)
### Files Included
data.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
simple_linear_regression.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and visualization.
### Usage
To run the notebook:

Clone this repository.
Install the required dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt).
Open the Jupyter Notebook simple_linear_regression.ipynb and execute each cell to see the results step by step.
